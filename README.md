# Exploratory Data Analysis on Sample Dataset

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on a sample dataset. 
The purpose of this analysis is simply **to explore this Data with minimal data wrangling.**


## Dataset

- Dataset: Dataset can be found on kaggle using this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chirag02/ford-gobike-2019feb-tripdata)
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in the month of February of 2019.

- File used: 201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv

- Description: The notebook is in two parts really:
* Part_I_exploration_template.ipynb: This notebook was basically an Exploratory notebook as in the name, the main focus was to make hypothesis inclined data visualisations
* Part_II_explanatory_template.ipynb: This notebook was to communicate the insights from the PartI Exploratory Notebook in extra details and Explanation.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data Wrangling
3. Univariate Analysis
4. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
5. Feature Engineering

## Key Findings
Note: The Key findings are what the `Part_II_explanatory_template.ipynb` notebook explicitly pointed out


## Libraries Used
- numpy: For basic numeric operations used
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib: For creating static visualizations
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed
3. Open the `Part_I_exploration_template.ipynb` and `Part_II_explanatory_template.ipynb` notebooks in your preferred environment
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis
